These directories are the result of gradually collected & created prep materials for Data Science interviews.

Files:

Terms to know - Lists of key terms to be aware of. DS.pdf and CS.pdf are the more important files.

Python - There are two main .ipynb files (Jupyter Notebooks). The ML & Probability one makes use of the images directory. This one is useful to go through for interviews that deal with regression, probability, A/B testing, and tree models. It's also just a good probability review in general. The Python_for_DS one makes use of the 4 data sources in the directory. It's based off the first few modules of Data Camp's "Python for Data Science" course. It walks through the basics of Python, NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, importing data, setting up SQL engines, and ML. Even some basic Neural Network stuff.

SQL - Several files. Beginner, intermediate, advanced are self-explanatory. Notes.sql is more of the same. Practice_queries.sql is a list of key query concepts that should be understood before an interview. It also includes an example dataset to use to practice on. This dataset and most practice queries are oriented towards Facebook-esque interview questions. example.sql has as link to a youtube video and another couple of SQL tables to practice on. I believe it also functions as a script that outputs to the desktop once run.

R - a brief R-markdown doc on the basics of R.

120-Interview-Questions.pdf - Self-explanatory. Answers to the probability section can be found on reddit somewhere.
